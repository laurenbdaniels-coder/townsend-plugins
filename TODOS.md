### Paste-prompt single-file fallback

**What:** Flatten `SKILL.md` plus `references/` into one paste-able prompt for attendees who have no CLI at all.

**Why:** Some Lovable, Replit and Bolt users never install anything; the degraded interview path covers most of the value, but only from inside a host that has the skill.

**Context:** Deferred at the 2026-09-17 plan gate (CEO E10, DX taste). Would be a generated artifact that must be regenerated whenever the skill text changes; it has no scanner, so no evidenced answers. Start from `custody-check/skills/custody-check/SKILL.md` and the two references; add a CI step that fails when the flattened file is stale.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** None

### Byte-ratio binary heuristic

**What:** Detect binary files by the ratio of non-text bytes instead of only a NUL in the first 8 KB.

**Why:** A few binary formats without early NULs get decoded and scanned noisily; a few text files with a stray NUL get skipped.

**Context:** Deferred at the Eng phase (Codex C6). `decode_text()` in `custody_scan.py` is the single place to change; count the new skip reason in `stats`.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** None

### `--git-timeout` flag

**What:** Expose the 15 s git budget as a flag.

**Why:** Very large repositories on slow disks can exceed the budget and report `git-timeout`.

**Context:** Declined for v0.1.0 (YAGNI). `GIT_BUDGET_S` in `custody_scan.py`.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** None

### skills.sh listing

**What:** List custody-check on skills.sh / `npx skills add`.

**Why:** One-command install through the channel vibe-coders already use.

**Context:** Kept out of scope by the design; revisit after the workshop shows whether attendees install at all.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** PR 2 evals

### Hosted demo sandbox

**What:** A public "try it without your own code" demo.

**Why:** Time-to-first-verdict without an export step.

**Context:** Declined: the design promise is that nothing leaves the machine. The PR 2 seeded-app fixture will double as a clonable demo folder linked from the README instead.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P4
**Depends on:** PR 2 evals
