# Changelog

The footer of every census names the version that produced it.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-20)

First release.

- **Census.** It lists every place this run finds where an app decides who can see a record, what something costs, whether someone has paid, and how money rounds. Each decision found in more than one place gets a two-answer card with a check you can run by hand. The census never says the app is clean.
- **Helper.** `census_scan.py` walks the app with custody-check's walk rules and never-open list. It prints one JSON line with paths, line numbers and fixed pattern names only, never text from inside a file. File names with unusual characters are held back and counted.
- **Bounded reading.** The agent reads up to 24 windows of 31 lines around listed places, and nothing else in the app.
- **Stop-line.** Sensitive field names in schema files (`card_number`, `date_of_birth` and the like), or the founder's answer, make the census say **Get a person**, with no booking link.
- **Tests.** Unit tests, a never-miss and noise test that compares every later version with the released one, and eight `claude plugin eval` cases run three times each before release.
